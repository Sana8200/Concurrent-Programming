# Homework 1: Critical Sections, Locks, Barriers, and Condition Variables

This assignment focuses on understanding and implementing fundamental concepts in concurrent programming using **POSIX threads (pthreads)**.

## Learning Objectives

The goals of this assignment are to:

- Understand **critical section problems** and why mutual exclusion is required
- Safely access **shared variables** using synchronization mechanisms
- Implement **mutual exclusion** with locks (mutexes)
- Program **condition synchronization** using condition variables
- Build a **concurrent parallel program** with multiple threads sharing data
- Create, manage, and join threads
- Pass input parameters to threads and collect results
- Synchronize threads using **locks, barriers, and condition variables**
- Compile and run a **multithreaded program** using the pthreads library

This assignment provides hands-on experience with designing, implementing, and debugging concurrent programs in C.
