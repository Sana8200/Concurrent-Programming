# Concurrent Programming Assignments

This repository contains solutions to a series of assignments for a course on **Concurrent and Distributed Programming**.

The course focuses on the foundations, principles, and practical techniques of concurrent, parallel, and distributed systems. The assignments provide hands-on experience with synchronization mechanisms, multithreading, shared-memory parallelism, and message-passing systems.

---

## Course Topics

- Concurrent programming concepts, models, and paradigms
- Processes and threads
- Mutual exclusion and condition synchronization
- Critical sections, locks, barriers, and condition variables
- Semaphores and monitors
- Concurrent objects (locking, lock-free, wait-free)
- Shared-memory parallelism (OpenMP)
- Distributed programming and message passing (MPI)
