# Concurrent Programming Assignments

This repository contains solutions to a series of assignments for a university-level course on **Concurrent and Distributed Programming**.

The course focuses on the foundations, principles, and practical techniques of concurrent, parallel, and distributed systems. The assignments provide hands-on experience with synchronization mechanisms, multithreading, shared-memory parallelism, and message-passing systems.

## Course Topics

- Concurrent programming concepts, models, and paradigms
- Processes and threads
- Mutual exclusion and condition synchronization
- Critical sections, locks, barriers, and condition variables
- Semaphores and monitors
- Concurrent objects (locking, lock-free, wait-free)
- Multicore architectures and performance models
- Shared-memory parallelism
- Distributed programming and message passing
- RPC, RMI, sockets, and MPI
- Introduction to parallelism in scientific computing
